    <div class="col-9 col-sm-12">
      My name is Hugo Davoust. I'm a Designer<span class="text-grey">+</span>Hacker with a strong focus on usability and user experience.
      <br><br>
      My goal is to create usable and lovable products for people. I like to say that great products should give superpowers. I'm good at solving problems, designing usable interfaces and creating delightful experiences. I'm obsessed with quality, I do believe that the details are not the details, they make the product.
      <br><br>
      I had the privilege to live in different places like Paris, San Francisco and London. These experiences give me a unique perspective to think differently and better understand people's needs and behaviors.
      <br><br>
      I enjoy my free time taking pictures, drawing, cooking veggie meals, running and travelling.
      <br><br>
      I also aim to be a superhero, but that's a secret story.
